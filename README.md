### RPGProject
A short passion project during my first unit through Lambda School where we were learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project utilizes mostly HTML and vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM in order to simulate an RPG Battler and was created in less than 1 week.
The focus of this project was on implementation and not design, so please forgive the complete lack of styling.

## Features
- Select one of six different characters
- Select one of three different core weapons
- Search for and battle up to 6 random monsters depending on character level
- Gain XP and level up, increasing character stats
- Lose XP upon death

## Goals
There are no future goals with this project other than some styling upgrades that it desperately needs. [This project is being recreated with React in this repo!](https://github.com/atcriteria/rpg-sim-fe)
