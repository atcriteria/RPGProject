### RPGProject
A short passion project during my first unit through Lambda School where we were learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project utilizes mostly HTML and vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM in order to simulate an RPG Battler and was created in less than 1 week.
The focus of this project was on implementation and not design, so please forgive the complete lack of styling.

## Features
- Select one of six different characters
- Select one of three different core weapons
- Search for and battle up to 6 random monsters depending on character level
- Gain XP and level up, increasing character stats
- Lose XP upon death

## Future Goals
I currently do not have any futurue goals with this project as my technical skills have increased beyond the scope of it.
That said, I would like to recreate this project with those technical skills and have outlined a few features that I would include, such as being able to create your own character with a given amount of points to allocate to things such as HP, SP, attack damage, and defense, an inventory system to handle changing equipment and receiving loot from monster battles, and in-game shops to spend fake in-game money on item upgrades and armors. This all would of course be saved on a back end and may even use third party authentication for user security.
